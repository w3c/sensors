Generic Sensor API
==================

This is the repo for the W3C Generic Sensor API specification. The goal of this specification is to drive consistency across sensor APIs, enable new use cases, and speed-up the cost of specifying and implementing new sensors.

The bulk of the work happens on [Github Issues][1]. [Contributions][2] are welcomed!
