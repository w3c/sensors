Generic Sensor API
==================

This is the repo for the W3C Generic Sensor API specification. The goal of this specification is to drive consistency across sensor APIs, enable new use cases, and speed-up and ease specification and implementation of new sensors as outlined in the [Designing A Generic Sensor API For The Web Platform](https://bocoup.com/work/generic-sensor-api-for-the-web-platform) article by the initial editor.

The bulk of the work happens on [Github Issues][1]. [Contributions][2] are welcomed!

You'll find the latest editorâ€™s draft here: https://w3c.github.io/sensors/

A usecase document is also in the works. It's available here: https://w3c.github.io/sensors/usecases.html

Answers to security and privacy Self-Review Questionnaire can be found [here][3]
